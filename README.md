# Face Recognition Web App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create VITE App](https://vite.dev/).

## Overview
This project is a web application developed using TypeScript.js and face-api.js for face recognition. The app allows users to detect and recognize faces in a live webcam stream using pre-trained models. It also includes the ability to label and recognize specific faces.

## Features

Real-time face detection and recognition using webcam
Labeling and recognition of known faces
Displaying bounding boxes and labels for recognized faces


## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### Clone the project repository:
### `git clone https://github.com/Prakashkakarlla/project_Face`

### Install dependencies:
### `cd project_Face`
### `npm install`

### Start the development server:
### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Usage

Allow the app to access your webcam.\
Wait for the app to load the models and start the webcam stream.\
Known faces (e.g., "Virat", "Messi", "Prakash") will be recognized and labeled in the video stream.\
The app will continuously detect and recognize faces in the video stream.
